Hereâ€™s a revised and more polished version of your **README** to better showcase your project and emphasize the CI/CD pipeline:

---

# **Simple Python Project**

## **Description**
This is a foundational Python project designed to demonstrate **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)** using GitHub Actions. The project includes:
- A simple `greet` function to illustrate basic Python functionality.
- Automated testing with `pytest` to ensure code quality.
- Code linting with `flake8` to enforce style consistency.

## **Features**
- **Automated Testing**: Ensures all changes are validated with unit tests.
- **Code Linting**: Enforces coding standards using `flake8`.
- **Cross-Version Testing**: Verifies compatibility across multiple Python versions.

---

## **CI/CD Pipeline**
The project uses a GitHub Actions workflow to automate:
1. **Linting**: Runs `flake8` to check for style issues.
2. **Testing**: Executes `pytest` on every push and pull request.
3. **Matrix Testing**: Tests the codebase across multiple Python versions (`3.8`, `3.9`, `3.10`, `3.11`).

### **Trigger Events**
The CI/CD pipeline runs automatically on:
- **Pushes**: Changes pushed to the `main` branch.
- **Pull Requests**: New or updated pull requests targeting `main`.
